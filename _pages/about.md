I'm a fourth year Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student at the Lahore University of Management Sciences interested in the following areas:

  - Interpretable AI
  - Generative AI
  - AI for Social Good 

I currently work at the [Center for Urban Informatics, Policy, and Technology (CITY)](https://city.lums.edu.pk/) as a research assistant and am looking for PhD positions.


Projects
--------
1. Buildings of the Future: Visualizing Change in Remote Sensing Data
    This is my final year project. We are using a combination of satellite images of areas before development has occured and building segmentation maps showing the planned layout of the area after development and trying to visualize how that would look. Such a tool would allow urban planners better understand how their proposed plans would alter the layout of the land once they have been implemented and perhaps alter them accordingly
    Keywords: Generative AI, cGANS, Remote Sensing, AI for Good 

2. [A Deep-Unfolded Spatiotemporal RPCA Network for L+S Decomposition](https://hamzaadnan.github.io/publication/A   Deep-Unfolded Spatiotemporal RPCA Network for L+S Decomposition/)
    
    A research based project I conducted with a senior RA and Professor at CITY. I was involved in discussing theoretical challenges and writing code to test the proposed algorithm.
    
    Keywords: RPCA, Deep-Unfolding, Background-Foreground Separation, Interpretable AI 

3. Vision Based Identification and Localization of Faults in Paper
    Final project for the course on Machine Learning at LUMS. Based on an industrial demand from a paper manufacture to help a high speed camera positioned above a conveyor belt detect faults on manufactured paper. I extracted multiple features including edges, HoG, Color Spectrogram, etc. and implemented classification algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Naive-Bayes Classifier, and Convolutional Neural Networks to classify the kind of fault present. Also had to localize the faults in the image by drawing bounding boxes.
    
    Keywords: Computer Vision, Classification, Localization

4. Solving Tic-Tac-Toe Using Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning
    Final project for the course Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. Consisted of the following three tasks:
    - 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe using Value Iteration
    - 4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe using Q-Iteration or Q-learning
    - 4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe using Q-Learning
  
  Keywords: Dynamic Programming, Reinforcement Learning, Value Iteration, Q-Learning

1. I love teaching.
    - Teaching Assistant for Signals and Systems (30+ students: mostly juniors)
    - Teaching Assistant for Applied Probability (60+ students: mostly graduate students, seniors, and some juniors)
    - Co-designed and am a Teaching Assistant for Design and Measurement Lab (40+ freshman students) (a lab on hardware interfacing, processing signals, and actuation)

2. Venture Analyst Intern at Fatima Gobi Ventures (Summer 2022)

3. Plant Intern at Lotte Chemicals Pakistan (2019)


Other

I like running (I'm a half marathon finisher and look forward to running a full one once this semester ends). I play amateur squash and love [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60401040-hamza-adnan) fiction, history, and politics.
